# SuprPixl
Superresolution with ![tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org "tensorflow.js")
 

## usage
open the ![training page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/adam-blip/SuprPixl/blob/master/training.html "training page") to start the training of the model in the browser. it runs for 500 epochs and saves the model in the browser local storage. after that (or running for more epochs, click the download button to save the weights.
open the ![prediction page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/adam-blip/SuprPixl/blob/master/prediction.html "prediction page") to upload the previously downloaded model files and upscale your own image.
